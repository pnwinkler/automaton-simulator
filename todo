IMMEDIATE GOALS
- finish conversion to new collision detection and object creation system
- if "toggle solution" still exists, determine what to do with it


STRETCH GOALS
- Implement a requirements file, such that absent/invalid library trigger a response
- If any other features need developing, develop them. If time is plenty, add some quality of life / improvement features,
such as:
 TIER 1:
 more attractive UI elements (makes report look better too)
 allow for user to rename states
 change state tooltip naming system to one which displays the name in the centre
 TIER 2:
 resizing (it seems like a grid layout might help), automatic repositioning


FINAL / ULTIMATE GOALS
- test on clean Ubuntu and Windows VMs
- write documentation
