A graphical simulator of deterministic finite automata, with quizzing element. Allows user to create and test automata (step-by-step or atomically), against randomly generated difficulty-graded regular expressions, or user-provided strings.

Requires:
Python 3.5 or newer
exrex
PyQt5

LGPL license is for Qt compliance.

Not yet ready for public use (it works, but it's somewhat buggy, and feature-incomplete). A comprehensive rework is underway, on the redone-collisions branch.
